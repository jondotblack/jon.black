At some point, every developer has worked with a front-end framework.  Whether it be Bootstrap, Material, or Tailwind, they each come with their own grid system.  After years of building component libraries for Amazon, American Express, and Spotify, I find the cleanest implementation to be using [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) or [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

I'm using this pattern with my website that is [open source](https://gitlab.com/jondotblack/jon.black) but created a [simplified repository](https://github.com/jondotblack/styled-system-emotion-grid-system) with only the required dependencies.


### Dependencies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
- [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/)
- [Jest](jestjs.io/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

I included basic snapshots for each component and a single test to make sure that child content is rendering correctly.  The ultimate intent is to demonstrate the testing utils that help with using Emotion's ThemeProvider.


### Components

Two general utility components that render as `div`'s by default, but extend the Style System's API for Color, Flexbox, Layout, and Spacing.

``` js:src/components/box/Box.js
<Box backgroundColor='blue' my={{ _: 3, md: 2 }} order='2'>...</Box>
```

``` js:src/components/box/Flex.js
<Flex alignContent='center' justifyContent='center'>...</Flex>
```

I prefer the pattern of being explicit with the nesting structure.  `Container` and `Col` extend the `Box` component with some additional styling, and `Row` extends `Flex`. 

All components support both single numeric value (`<Col span={6}>...</Col>`) and passing an object of breakpoints (`<Col span={{ _: 6, md: 4, lg: 3 }}>...</Col>`).  View the [Storybook docs](https://jondotblack.github.io/styled-system-emotion-grid-system/?path=/docs/components-grid--base) for more examples.

``` js
 <Container fluid>
  <Row>
    # basic usage
    <Col span={{ sm: '6', md: '4', xl: '3' }}>...</Col>

    # auto
    <Col span="auto">...</Col>

    # order
    <Col order={{ sm: 1, md: 2 }}>...</Col>

    # offset
    <Col offset={2} span={4}>...</Col>
  </Row>
</Container>
```

### Customize Theme

In the `styles` directory, there is a basic `theme.js` file.  Here you can configure the breakpoints, number of columns, and gutter width.  It follows the same pattern as Bootstrap, but changing these values is all that's required to get working.

``` js:src/styles/theme.js
export const theme = { ... };

/* 
  using Styled System variants requires an array of 
  breakpoints, aliases added for ease of use
*/
const breakpoints = ['576px', '768px', '992px', '1200px', '1400px'];
theme.breakpoints = breakpoints;
theme.breakpoints.xs = '0';
[
  theme.breakpoints.sm,
  theme.breakpoints.md,
  theme.breakpoints.lg,
  theme.breakpoints.xl,
  theme.breakpoints.xxl,
] = breakpoints;

theme.grid = {
  columns: 12,
  gutter: '24px',
  maxWidth: theme.breakpoints.xxl,
};
```
